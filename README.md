## Acknowledgments

- Built using [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro).
- This tool was developed as a response to the frequent updates of Google Chrome, which often cause automation extensions to become unavailable. The goal was to provide a reliable, standalone solution for automating navigation tasks without depending on browser extensions.
